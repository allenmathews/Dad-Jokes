# Dad-Jokes
This is the 10th project as part of the 50 projects in 50 days series by Traversy Media and Florin Pop. 
I made this project using the async await functionality on the API from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api.

The project will help users to get dad jokes on the click of a button. 
Users will be able to get new dad jokes every time they click on the 'Get Another Joke' button.
